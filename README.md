# Voybit payment gateway for Ruby

## Get an API key

1. Create an account at [dashboard.voybit.com](https://dashboard.voybit.com).
2. Open **Gateways**, create a payment gateway, enable the assets customers may choose, and store its webhook secret as `VOYBIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. Open **API keys**, choose **Create secret key**, and bind it to that gateway. Copy the full `vb_live_…` value once and store it as `VOYBIT_API_KEY` on your server.

Create a payment and verify its webhook. Keep the API key and webhook secret on your server. Requires Ruby 3.1 or later.

```ruby
require "voybit/payment_gateway"
```

Gem name: `voybit-payment-gateway`. Repository: [github.com/VOYBIT/voybit-payment-gateway-ruby](https://github.com/VOYBIT/voybit-payment-gateway-ruby).

## Create a buyer-choice checkout

`POST https://api.voybit.com/api/v1/gateway/checkout-sessions`

| Header | |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Voybit-Api-Key` | Gateway API key. |
| `Idempotency-Key` | 8–128 characters: letters, digits, `.` `_` `:` `-`. Reuse it only with the same body. |

| Field | |
| --- | --- |
| `fiat_amount` | Required positive decimal string, such as `25.00`. |
| `fiat_currency` | Required: `USD`, `EUR`, or `GBP`. |
| `payment_window_seconds` | Optional. 300–86400. Default 900. |
| `description` | Optional. Maximum 500 characters. |
| `metadata` | Optional object. Maximum 16 KiB. |

A new payment returns `201`. The same key and body return `200`. A different body returns `409`.

Send the payer to `checkout_url`. The payer chooses from the gateway’s enabled assets and confirms a live quote before the address and QR are created. Fulfil an order only when `status` is `paid` or `overpaid`.

```ruby
client = Voybit::PaymentGateway::Client.new(api_key: ENV["VOYBIT_API_KEY"])
created = client.create_checkout_session({
  fiat_amount: "25.00",
  fiat_currency: "USD",
  description: "Order 1001",
  metadata: { order_id: "1001" }
}, "order:1001:attempt:1")
```

## Webhook

Read the raw body and verify it before parsing. The signature is `v1=` plus HMAC-SHA256 of `<id>.<timestamp>.<raw body>`, using the gateway webhook secret.

| Header | |
| --- | --- |
| `Voybit-Webhook-Id` | Delivery id. Ignore a repeat. |
| `Voybit-Webhook-Timestamp` | Unix seconds. Reject values outside 5 minutes. |
| `Voybit-Webhook-Signature` | `v1=` and the hex signature. |

`type` is `payment.` plus the status, for example `payment.paid`.

```ruby
raw_body = request.body.read
Voybit::PaymentGateway::Client.verify_webhook(
  secret: ENV["VOYBIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET"],
  id: request.get_header("HTTP_VOYBIT_WEBHOOK_ID"),
  timestamp: request.get_header("HTTP_VOYBIT_WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP"),
  signature: request.get_header("HTTP_VOYBIT_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE"),
  raw_body: raw_body
)
event = Voybit::PaymentGateway::Client.parse_event(raw_body)
```
